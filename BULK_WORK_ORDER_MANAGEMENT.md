# Bulk Work Order Management System

## Overview

The Bulk Work Order Management System is designed to handle multiple work orders efficiently, especially when dealing with large numbers of work orders and repeating items. This system provides smart quantity allocation, real-time status tracking, and bulk operations to streamline the manufacturing process.

## Key Features

### 1. **Bulk Work Order Manager**
- **Purpose**: Centralized management of multiple work orders for a single sales order
- **Benefits**: 
  - Handle 100+ work orders efficiently
  - Smart quantity allocation across multiple work orders
  - Real-time status tracking
  - Bulk delivery processing

### 2. **Smart Quantity Allocation**
- **Automatic Distribution**: When you deliver 50 units of an item that has 3 work orders of 50 each, the system automatically allocates the 50 to the first work order
- **Priority-Based**: Work orders are allocated based on creation date (first created gets priority)
- **Remaining Tracking**: Shows pending quantities for remaining work orders

### 3. **Live Status Tracking**
- **Per Work Order**: Individual work order status and delivery progress
- **Per Sales Order**: Overall sales order delivery status
- **Real-Time Updates**: Status updates dynamically as users modify quantities
- **Completion Percentage**: Visual progress indicators

### 4. **Bulk Stock Entry Processing**
- **Single Interface**: Process stock entries for multiple items at once
- **Validation**: Ensures delivery quantities don't exceed pending quantities
- **Auto-Creation**: Automatically creates stock entries for manufacturing
- **Smart Allocation**: Distributes delivered quantities across work orders intelligently
- **Stock Entry Type Control**: Supports both "Material Transfer for Manufacture" and "Manufacture" types
- **Auto-Detection**: Automatically detects stock entry type based on item BOMs

## How It Works

### 1. **Sales Order Processing**
```
Sales Order → Work Orders → Bulk Work Order Manager → Stock Entry
```

### 2. **Quantity Allocation Logic**
```
Example: 150 total units across 3 work orders (50 each)
User delivers: 50 units
Result: 
- Work Order 1: 50 delivered (complete)
- Work Order 2: 0 delivered (pending)
- Work Order 3: 0 delivered (pending)
```

### 3. **Status Tracking**
- **Pending**: No units delivered
- **Partially Delivered**: Some units delivered but not complete
- **Fully Delivered**: All ordered units delivered

## Usage Guide

### Step 1: Create Bulk Work Order Manager

1. **Navigate to**: Manufacturing Addon → Bulk Work Order Manager
2. **Select Sales Order**: Choose the sales order with multiple work orders
3. **Auto-Population**: System automatically fetches all work orders and creates summaries

### Step 2: Review Work Order Summary

The system provides three views:

#### **Work Order Summary Table**
- **Item-wise aggregation**: Shows total ordered, delivered, and pending quantities per item
- **Work order count**: Number of work orders per item
- **Status**: Overall delivery status per item

#### **Work Order Details Table**
- **Individual work orders**: Detailed view of each work order
- **Progress tracking**: Shows ordered, delivered, and pending quantities
- **Status indicators**: Work order status and delivery status

#### **Bulk Delivery Items Table**
- **Delivery interface**: Where you enter quantities to be delivered
- **Auto-population**: Shows pending quantities automatically
- **Validation**: Prevents over-delivery

### Step 3: Process Bulk Stock Entry

1. **Select Stock Entry Type**: Choose between "Material Transfer for Manufacture" or "Manufacture"
2. **Auto-Detect Type**: Enable to automatically detect type based on item BOMs
3. **Enter Delivery Quantities**: Specify how much to deliver for each item
4. **Select Warehouses**: Choose source/target warehouses based on stock entry type
5. **Auto-Fill Option**: Use "Auto Fill Delivery" to fill with pending quantities
6. **Submit**: System processes the stock entry automatically

### Step 4: Monitor Progress

- **Live Status**: Use "Live Status" button for real-time updates
- **Progress Indicators**: Visual completion percentages
- **Dashboard Cards**: Quick overview of totals and counts

## Stock Entry Type Control

### **Understanding Stock Entry Types**

The system supports two types of stock entries in manufacturing:

#### **1. Material Transfer for Manufacture**
- **Purpose**: Transfer raw materials to work order for manufacturing
- **Source**: Raw material warehouse
- **Target**: Work order (system sets)
- **Use Case**: When transferring raw materials to work order
- **Item Type**: Raw materials (is_finished_item = 0)

#### **2. Manufacture**
- **Purpose**: Record finished goods production from work order
- **Source**: Work order (system sets)
- **Target**: Finished goods warehouse
- **Use Case**: When recording finished goods production
- **Item Type**: Finished goods (is_finished_item = 1)

### **Auto-Detection Logic**

The system automatically detects stock entry type based on:

1. **BOM Check**: If item has an active default BOM → "Manufacture"
2. **No BOM**: If item has no BOM → "Material Transfer for Manufacture"
3. **Manual Override**: User can manually select stock entry type

### **Warehouse Configuration**

#### **Material Transfer for Manufacture**
```
Source Warehouse: User selected (raw materials)
Target Warehouse: System sets (work order)
```

#### **Manufacture**
```
Source Warehouse: System sets (work order)
Target Warehouse: User selected (finished goods)
```

    for wo in work_orders:
        if remaining_qty <= 0:
            break
        
        pending_qty = wo.qty - wo.produced_qty
        if pending_qty <= 0:
            continue
        
        allocation_qty = min(remaining_qty, pending_qty)
